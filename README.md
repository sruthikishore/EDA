Overview of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Objectives of EDA

1)Understanding the Dataset: Grasp the structure, variables, and relationships.
2)Identifying Patterns: Detect underlying trends.
3)Spotting Anomalies: Find outliers or anomalies.
4)Hypothesis Testing: Test hypotheses about the data.
5)Assumption Checking: Validate assumptions for further analysis.
